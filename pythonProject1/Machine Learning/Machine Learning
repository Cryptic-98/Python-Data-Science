Machine learning - the study of methods for programming languages to learn.
                 - building machines that automatically learn from experience.
                 - refers to the changes in systems that perform tasks associated with AI.
Steps in machine learning:
1. Data Collection
2. Representation
3. Modeling
4. Estimation
5. Validation
Advantages of Machine Learning:
- Solving problems
- Intelligence drawn from common sense AI
- Reducing constraints over time achieving complete autonomy.
Disadvantages
- Application specific algorithms.
- Real world problems have too many variables and sensors might be too noisy.
- Computational complexity.
Types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning (reinforcement)

Unsupervised learning
- studies how input patterns can be represented to reflect the statistical structure of the overall collection of inout patterns
- no outputs are used
- learning is provided only unlabeled data
- no feedback is provided from the environment
**Advantage:
- most of the laws of science were developed through unsupervised learning.
**Disadvantage:

Supervised learning
