Supervised learning
- Regression is a statistical approach used to analyze the relationship between a dependant variable (target variable)
  one or more independent variables (predictor variables).
- The objective is to determine the most suitable function that characterizes the connection between these variables.
- it seeks to find the best-fit model, which can be utilized to make predictions or draw conclusions.

The Three Main Metrics that are used for evaluating the trained regression model are:
1. Variance
2. Bias
3. Error
If Variance is high, it leads to overfitting, and when bias is high, it leads to underfitting.
- based on the number of input features and output labels, regression is classified as linear (one input and one output),
  multiple regression (many inputs and one output), and multivariate (many outputs)
- Linear regression allows us to plot linear questions i.e. a straight line. We need to tune the coefficient and bias of the linear
  equation over the training data for accurate prediction.
  Linear regression equation:
  y = B0 + B1X
  where
  y is the dependent variable
  x is the independent variable
  B0 is the intercept
  B1 is the slope
