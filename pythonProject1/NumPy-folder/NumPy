NumPy - a fundamental package that is used for numerical computation.
- it provides mathematical functions to compute data as well as functions to operate multidimensional arrays and matrices efficiently.
Arrays - these are a collection of elements of the same data type. (they are homogeneous)
- arrays occupy fixed memory.
- we do not have array data structures in python. (we only have NumPy arrays)
- we can create arrays using NumPy from lists and tuples.
Uses of NumPy:
1. Data Analysis -
2. Machine Learning and A.I. -
3. Scientific Computations - biology, chemistry, physics, quantum computing.
4. Array Manipulation -
- we are able to perform arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) equations
- arrays are indexed. (from zero until n - 1)
- 2D arrays consist of rows and columns
