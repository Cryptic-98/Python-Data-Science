Box plots - it is a way to visualise the distribution of data using a box and some vertical lines. It is also known as a whisker
            plot
- The data can be distributed between 6 key ranges:
1. Minimum: Q(minimum Q-1.5)
2. 1 quartile (Q1) : 25th percentile
3. Median: 50th percentile
4. 3rd quartile: Q3: 75th percentile
5. Maximum: Q3 + 1.5
6. Mean

- Those points which are out of range of the boxplot are called outliers. We can creaer the boxplot of the data to determine th
  following:
- The number of outliers in a dataset.
- to determine whether the data is skewed or not.
- to determine the range of data3
