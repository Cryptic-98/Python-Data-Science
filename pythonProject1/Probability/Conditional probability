In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of an event occurring, given that another event is already known to have
occurred.
Bayes Theorem - a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability.

- it provides a way to revise existing prediction or theories given new or additional evidence.
- conditional probability also uses the law of totality.
  formula for Bayes Theorem:
  P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
  = P(A).P(B|A) / P(B)
  which normally applies to disjoint events.
  P(A) - probability of A occurring.
  P(B) - probability of B occurring.
  P(A|B) - probability of A given B
  P(B|A) - probability of B given A
  P(A ∩ B) - probability of both A and B occurring.

Law of totality - given n mutually exclusive events A1, A2, A3, ..., Ak such that thier probabilities sum is unity and their union is
the event E, then Ai b Aj = Null for all is not equal to j.
A1 u A2 u A3, ..., u Ak = E
Total probability theorem or law of totality is given by P(B) = P(B/A1) × P(B/A2) × P(A2) + ... + P(B/Ak) × P(Ak)

There are three bagss that contain 100 marbles.

- Bag 1 has 75 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.
- Bag 2 has 60 red marbles and 40 blue marbles.
- Bag 3 has 45 red marbles and 55 blue marbles.
  if you choose one if the bags at random then pick a marble from the chosen bag, also at random.
  What is the probability that the marble chosen is red?

P(B) = P(B/A1) × P(A1) + P(B/A2) × P(A2) + ... + P(B/Ak) × P(Ak)
P(red marble) = P(red marble/bag 1) × P(bag 1) + P(red marble/bag 2) × P(bag 2) + P(red marble/bag 3) × P(bag 3)
P(red marble) = (75/100 × 1/3) + (60/100 × 1/3) + (45/100 × 1/3)
P(red marble) = 1/4 + 1/5 + 3/20
P(red marble) = 3/5 (60%)

A person has undertaken a mining job. The probabilities of completion of the job on time with and without rain are 0.42 and 0.90
respectively. If the probability that it will rain is 0.45, then determine the probability that the mining job will be completed
on time.

P(B) = P(B/A1) × P(A1) + P(B/A2) × P(A2) + ... + P(B/Ak) × P(Ak)
P(job complete) = P(job complete/no rain) × P(no rain) + P(job complete/rain) × P(rain)
P(job complete) = (0.90 × 0.55) + (0.42 × 0.45)
P(job complete) = 0.495 + 0.189
P(job complete) = 0.684 (68.4%)
