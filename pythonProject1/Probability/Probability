Probability Theory
- Probability is a measure of the likelihood or chance of an event occurring.
- is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 where 1 dignifies a certain event, and 0 signifies an impossible event.
- it is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes.
- rolling a dice
what is the probability of getting a 4.
total number of outcomes = 6
- the favorable outcome of getting a 4, is 1.
probability = 1/6
Terms:
1. Outcome - this means any possible result in a group of results, called a sample space.
2. Sample space - the collection of all possible outcomes in an experiment.
3. Event - any part of a sample space. If for instance, event A happens, it means one of the outcomes in A has occurred.
4. Trial - each time you do an experiment, like flipping a coin.

Probability is represented by "P"
P(A) - probability of event A.

Example:
A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled and one card is drawn at random. What is the theoretical probability of
drawing a heart.
P(A) = 13/52
     = 25%

A bag contains 4 black, 6 white, and 10 yellow balls. A ball is drawn at random. What is the theoretical probability of
drawing a black and yellow ball?
Outcome of pulling black = 4/20
Outcome of pulling yellow = 10/20
P(B) = 14/20
     = 70%

Rules of probability:
1. Additional Rule - used when you want to find the probability of at least one of two mutually exclusive events.
For two mutually exclusive events A and B occurring, is found by adding the individual probabilities of A and B.
P(A u B) - which can be written as P(A or B)
P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B) where the probability of A and B occurring is

Suppose events X and Y are independent, and the probabilities are as follows:
- P(X) = 0.6
- P(Y) = 0.4
Calculate P(X u Y), assuming P(X n Y) = P(X) × P(Y):
P(X n Y) = 0.24
P(X u Y) = 0.76

2. Multiplication Rule:
- is used you want to find the probability of two independent events happening together. To find the chance of two events
  A and B happening at the same time, multiplication is used.
P(A n B) = P(A) × P(B)
where P(A|B) is the likelihood of event B happening when event A has already occurred.
1. Independent events
P(A n B) = P(A) × P(B)
2. Dependent events
P(A n B) = P(A) × P(A|B)
where P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B happening when event A has already occurred.

A bag contains 5 red marbles and 3 blue marbles. Two marbles are drawn without replacement.
What is the probability that both marbles drawn are red.

P(A n B) = P(A) × P(A|B)
- when one marble is drawn for the first time
  P(A) = 5/8
  - total possible remaining - 7
  - if a red marble is drawn without replacement, what is the chance of getting another red marble.
  P(A) = 4/7
  P(A n B) = 5/8 × 4/7
