Handling Missing Data
- Missing data can occur when no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit.
- the purpose of handling missing data is to avoid data inconsistency and data redundancy.
- they cause underfitting or perhaps overfitting.
- missing data is a very big problem in real life scenarios.
- missing data is referred to as NA (Not Available)

checking for missing values using isnull() and notnull()
- these methods return a boolean

Filling missing values using fillna(), replace, interpolate()
- in order to fill values in a dataset we use fillna() function. These functions replace NaN values with some
  values woth some values of their own.
- all these functions help in filling a null value in a data frame.
