Panda - an open source library that is built on top of NumPy.
It offers various data structures and operations for manipulation numerical data and time series
It uses 3 data structures which are:
1. Series
2. DataFrames
3. Panel
Uses:
1. Import and work on datasets
2. Data cleaning
3. Used where size mutability is important
4. Data normalization
Series
- A 1D data structure that is homogeneous in its nature and its size is immutable
- By using Pandas libraries with series we are able to create heterogeneous series that are indexed
We can also change the index from the default index
We can create pandas series from dictionaries
